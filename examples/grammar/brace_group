# Although the need for a delimiter at the end of the compound_list
# is not explicit in the grammar (a compound list can also consist of
# a single term or a list of new lines followed with a term), the need
# for a delimiter, ';' or newlines, to recognize the closing '}' is hinted
# in the text description in "Grouping Commands", and omitting the delimiter
# is rejected by both dash and bash. As described in the grammar, '&' can
# also be used as end delimiter.

# A BRACE GROUP IS:

# braces around a compound list using ';' as end delimiter
{ compound_list; }

# OR braces around a compound list using '&' as end delimiter
{ compound_list& }

# OR braces around a compound list using newlines as end delimiter
{ compound_list
