Learn Shell from source
=======================

The Saga of Code is a series of experiments for programmers
to learn a language by:

1. reading an authoritative specification and
   writing short examples of code to illustrate the specification

2. running the examples using an open source implementation
   and reading the source code to understand observed behaviors

In the first episode of the series, I learn Unix Shell programming
from [POSIX Shell and Utilities specification][POSIX_SHELL]
and the source code of [DASH][].

[POSIX_SHELL]: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/contents.html
[DASH]: http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/
